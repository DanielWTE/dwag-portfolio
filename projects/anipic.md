## What is AniPic?
To be serious, I've had the idea right now (18.02.2023).

AniPic is a website where you can filter and search for frames / images from anime series by entering the anime name, or other tags like "crying", "smiling", "fighting" or "Rainy Weather".
All frames / images are categorized and tagged by AI and different tools. The AI is detecting what is happening in the image, what is the background, the anime name etc.

So my plan is to cut up a lot of anime series into frames and store them on a media server. Then I will use AI to categorize, tag and finally store them in a database.


The feature list:
1. No authentication (Everyone can use it)
2. It should be fast to search and filter (Also with a lot of data)
 
## How I will do it
For AniPic I will use following tools:
1. NextJS & TailWindCSS (Frontend) NodeJS (Backend)
2. MongoDB (Database)
3. Python (AI, Image processing, etc.)
5. Docker (Containerization)
6. A lot of computing power (I will use my own server**s** for this project ðŸ˜¥)

## Logo and Name
Okkayy yeah I know, the logo is not that good. But I'm not a designer, also I've inspired myself from the logo of "anilist.co". Oh yeah the name :D I've just combined "Anime" and "Picture" and it was "AniPic" ðŸ˜‚
