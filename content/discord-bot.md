## What is Discord?
Discord is a free voice, video and text chat app for gamers. It's available on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Web, etc.).

## What is a Discord Bot?
A Discord Bot is a program that can be added to a Discord server. It can do a lot of things like playing music, sending memes, sending images, sending text, etc.

## What is the Belle Delphine Discord Bot?

The Belle Delphine Discord Bot is the first Discord Bot that I've created. It's also the first discord bot on discord which sends Belle Delphine's content, like images, videos and so on - 24/7.

Also the bot is sending a lot of other things like onlyfans content.
If you don't know what onlyfans is, it's a website where you can subscribe to a lot of different creators and get access to their content (the bot is using free content).

It's not only a discord bot, it's also a website. You can visit the website [here](https://belledelphine.gg/).
I've builded a complete streaming system for the bot, so it's possible to stream the bot's content on the website.

## How I've created the bot
With the help of the Discord.js library, I've created the bot. The bot is written in TypeScript and it's using MongoDB as a database.

## How im hosting the content
I have 2 CDNs one in US and the other one in germany, there is also a NGINX load balancer and cloudflare.
The CDNs are big VPSs with a lot of storage and bandwidth.

## How many people are using the bot?
The bot is currently in 1.2k servers and it's growing every day.

## What I've used to create this service
1. Node.js 
2. TypeScript (Axios, Discord.js, etc.)
3. MongoDB (Database)
4. PHP (Frontend, Backend etc.)
5. JavaScript (JQuery, AJAX)
6. A lot of linux knowledge

Maybe I will write a tutorial about how to create a discord bot in the future, and how I've made the Belle Delphine Discord Bot in detail. :)
