In the 3th grade of the professional school I were not the best one in the informatics course because I wasn't the best one in learning the theory part of JAVA, so yeah my teacher wanted a project from me.

I've decided to create a website where you as a school can enter your students, their grades, teachers, classes etc.
So it was just a school management system.

I've created the website with following tools:
1. PHP (Backend)
2. JavaScript (JQuery, AJAX, DataTables, Select2)
3. MongoDB

it was a really simple website with a login, dashboard, student, teacher, class, subject and a grade management system.
